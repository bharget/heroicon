## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "heroicon"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Run the installer
```bash
$ rails g heroicon:install
```

## Usage

To use a icon in your views, simply use the provided view helper with the name of an icon.

```rb
<%= heroicon "search" %>
```

Heroicon comes with two variants, `:outline` and `:solid`. The default variant is `:solid`. This can be changed in `config/initializers/heroicon.rb`, which is generated during installation. To overwrite this in the view, use

```rb
<%= heroicon "search", variant: :outline %>
```

You can also pass HTML options directly to the icon.

```rb
<%= heroicon "search", options: { class: "text-primary-500" } %>
```

Heroicon currently supports icons up to [`Version 1.0.1`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons/releases/tag/v1.0.1). If there is a icon that is missing, feel free to contribute by following our contributing guide below.
