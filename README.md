Ruby on Rails view helpers for the beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons, Heroicons.

Used in production at [Morning Brew â˜•](https://www.morningbrew.com/?utm_source=bharget_github)

This gem has no official affiliation with Tailwind CSS or the Heroicon team (yet!). Check out their sites:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "heroicon"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Run the installer

```bash
$ rails g heroicon:install
```

## Usage

To use a icon in your views, simply use the provided view helper with the name of an icon.

```rb
<%= heroicon "search" %>
```

Heroicon comes with two variants, `:outline` and `:solid`. The default variant is `:solid`. This can be changed in `config/initializers/heroicon.rb`, which is generated during installation (See [Configuration](#configuration)). To overwrite this in the view, use

```rb
<%= heroicon "search", variant: :outline %>
```

You can also pass HTML options directly to the icon.

```rb
<%= heroicon "search", options: { class: "text-primary-500" } %>
```

Heroicon currently supports icons up to [`Version 1.0.1`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons/releases/tag/v1.0.1). If there is a icon that is missing, feel free to contribute by following our contributing guide below.

# Configuration

After running `rails g heroicon:install` in the installation step, a configuration file will be created at `config/initializers/heroicon.rb`.

Currently there are two configuration options:

- `variant`: The default variant to use if no variant is specified in the view.
  - You can set this to either `:outline` or `:solid`. Defaults to `:solid`.
- `default_class`: A default class that gets applied to every icon.
  - This accepts either a String to apply to every icon, or a Hash, which applies the class based on the variant of the icon (see the example below).
  - You can disable this on a per-icon basis by passing `disable_default_class: true` in the options hash within the view.
  - _Note: If you use the `default_class` option with PurgeCSS (or something similar), make sure you add the classes you want to use to the generated CSS file. For PurgeCSS, you may want to add `config/intializers/heroicon.rb` to the list of purged paths._

An example configuration looks like this:

```ruby
Heroicon.configure do |config|
  config.variant = :solid
  config.default_class = {solid: "h-5 w-5", outline: "h-6 w-6"}
end
```

Disabling the default class in the view:

```rb
<%= heroicon "search", options: { class: "custom-class" disable_default_class: true } %>
```
